--  EllesmereUIActionPalette.lua  --  hold-to-open action palette for EllesmereUI
--
--  Hold a keybind -> a set of slots appears. Choose one, release the key to
--  fire it. Releasing without having chosen cancels, and so does ESCAPE, which
--  every layout answers to for as long as it is open.
--
--  One palette of actions, drawn and steered three ways:
--
--    ARC     entries spread over `arcSpan` degrees, steered by the ANGLE from
--            the centre. The sectors are unbounded in depth, so the gesture is
--            a flick rather than a click. A span of 360 is the whole turn.
--    FAN     a strip running along one axis, horizontal or vertical by
--            `fanOrientation`. Scroll-steered it cycles a compressed window
--            past a fixed centre; pointer-steered it is a GRID one entry deep.
--    GRID    every entry at a fixed cell, the nearest one zoomed.
--
--  The layouts differ in INPUT MODEL -- angle, scroll-cycle, pointer-nearest --
--  which is why they are separate rather than parameters of one another. The
--  span is the exception: it is a parameter of the angular model, so the full
--  turn the module opened life as is simply the arc's 360-degree case.
--
--  Each palette owns one hidden SecureActionButtonTemplate button; the palette's
--  keybind is routed to it with SetOverrideBindingClick, and it is registered
--  for "AnyDown","AnyUp":
--
--    key DOWN -> our PreClick opens the palette; a secure snippet wrapped around
--                OnClick clears "type", so the press itself fires nothing
--    key UP   -> the snippet works out which entry the cursor is on and writes
--                that slot's action attributes, the secure handler performs the
--                cast, and our PostClick closes the palette
--
--  The choosing has to happen inside the snippet because an addon may not write
--  attributes to a protected frame during combat -- see the Secure activation
--  section for the blocked-action this design was built around. Only the
--  angular layouts are steered in the snippet so far; the others still commit
--  from Lua and therefore only fire out of combat.
--
--  Protected calls in this file, all of them deferred to PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED
--  when in combat: the override-binding updates, and PushPalette's writes of a
--  palette's contents onto the secure buttons.

-- CreateLiveView is reached from OnEnable, which runs under the parent's

local MAX_CHILDREN = 8

-- How many concentric rings a nested arc's children may spill into before a

-- some unbounded radius -- eight entries in a ten-degree sector used to land a
-- ring three times the width of the palette itself. The cap keeps that answer
-- bounded on both sides: the live view and the snippet only ever carry
-- MAX_CHILD_ROWS worth of ring attributes, so a claim that would need a fifth
-- ring degrades by crowding the fourth instead of drifting the two out of
-- step with each other.
local MAX_CHILD_ROWS = 4

-- How many rect gates a single claim's REGION may be built from. One box
-- (HALO, whose ring already sits close enough round its parent that the old
-- bounding box was the true shape), three for a nest that sits in one piece
-- off one side of the block (the parent's own cell, the nest's own tight box,
-- and a corridor one child cell wide connecting them), and five for a lane
-- with the block to itself: the parent's cell plus one box per side of the
-- block its run reached, and a full run can wrap onto all four. One
-- box across the lot instead would swallow the block's own corner ground --
-- see PerimeterNest, the "Arming gates" section and RunReach below.
--
-- Nine is what a lane sharing the block with OTHER claims comes to. Each of
-- those has its own cell taken out of this claim's coverage (see ParentHoles),
-- which splits the side it falls on into at most a slab clear of it and one
-- interval reaching back to the parent -- the pieces past it are dropped, being
-- ground this claim cannot be armed on anyway. Three sides carrying a hole is
-- the worst that comes up: eight for any two claims and nine for any three,
-- swept over every arrangement of them on a 2x2, 6-, 9- and 12-slot block at
-- both child counts that change the answer and at every nest scale, and a block
-- with EVERY slot nesting stays inside it too. Past nine the tail is dropped,
-- child-bearing pieces being written first, so a palette that did overflow would
-- lose ground between its entries rather than a child.

--  Database
--
--  Everything under DB_DEFAULTS.profile lives in the suite's central store, at
--  EllesmereUIDB.profiles[<name>].addons.EllesmereUIActionPalette (see
--  EllesmereUI.Lite.NewDB). That placement is the whole profile integration:
--  the data follows whichever profile the character resolves to, a profile
--  swap or import repoints db.profile and reaches _EAP_Apply through
--  RefreshAllAddons (EllesmereUI_Profiles.lua:1433), and profile export and
--  import carry the table because the module is listed in ADDON_DB_MAP
--  (EllesmereUI_Profiles.lua:83). A new setting only needs a default here to
--  be per-profile and exportable -- there is nothing else to register.
--
--  Two kinds of state must NOT be added under profile: per-character or
--  account-wide state (keybinds, for example, stay in WoW's binding system),
--  and anything read outside db.profile through a cached reference (P() is
--  the accessor that stays correct across a swap). If the module ever grows
--  unlock-anchored elements, their key prefix must also be added to
--  KEY_PREFIX_FOLDER in EllesmereUI_Profiles.lua.

--  Per-palette appearance
--
--  A palette carries its own SHAPE and PLACE: which layout it is drawn as,
--  where it opens, how big, and every setting that only means anything inside
--  one of those layouts. Everything else -- the selection color, the hub art,
--  the labels, the nesting geometry, flick-ahead -- stays profile-wide, because
--  those describe the module's look rather than one palette's arrangement, and
--  a suite of palettes that each looked different would read as several addons.
--
--  Every one of these is an OVERRIDE, not a value: a palette that has never
--  been given one reads the profile's, which is what makes this change invisible
--  to a profile written before it existed. That is also the whole of the
--  saved-variables migration -- there is nothing to move, because the old flat
--  keys are exactly the fallback the new ones fall back to.
--
--  Stored under palette.appearance rather than flat on the palette. A palette
--  already carries name, icon and slots, and a flat store would put profile
--  keys in the same namespace as those -- fine for today's key set and a trap
--  for the first profile key ever named "icon".

-- every marker UI shows, 0 for the entry that clears instead of placing. The
-- engine numbers its WORLD markers differently, so the world kind maps the
-- stored position onto the engine's number before it names one.
--
-- The engine runs blue, green, purple, red, yellow, orange, silver, white --
-- square, triangle, diamond, cross, star, circle, moon, skull. Blizzard's
-- WORLD_RAID_MARKER_ORDER (Blizzard_CompactRaidFrameManager.lua:5-12) is the

--  reload rather than restarting at the star. It is NOT what the press reads,
--  though: an insecure SetAttribute is refused in combat, which is exactly when
--  marking matters, so the secure snippet keeps the authoritative copy and
--  advances it itself. CyclePosBack hands the snippet's answer back here after

-- One rect covering a nest run AND the ground between it and the parent's own
-- cell: the corridor folded into the run rather than standing beside it. That is
-- what lets a run with cells on more than one side of the block have EVERY side
-- of it reachable -- a reach for a child round the far side of a corner leaves
-- the parent cell diagonally, and a claim with one corridor pointing at one side
-- loses the cursor the moment it aims at another -- without spending a region
-- gate per side on the corridors alone.
--
-- The PARENT'S OWN CELL folded in, rather than a corridor drawn between the two:
-- a rect is convex, so a rect holding both ends of a line holds every point of
-- it, and a reach IS a line -- a hand goes straight at the icon it wants. Any
-- corridor narrower than that leaves some straight reach crossing ground the
-- claim does not hold, however carefully it is aimed: a corridor laid across the
-- gap the two boxes leave in ONE direction is exited by a reach that leaves the
-- parent cell through a different edge. That was measurable -- a reach for the
-- far end of a run wrapped round a corner left the claim less than two units
-- short of the run's own rect, disarmed mid-reach, and fired the plain entry the
-- cursor came to rest over instead of the child it was aimed at.
--
-- What it costs is honest: the sweep from the parent's cell out to a run stands
-- over whatever plain entries lie in it -- for a parent in the middle of a block
-- the ones between it and its lane, which the corridor this replaces covered too
-- (that was as wide as the whole nest), and for a parent on the block's own edge
-- the rest of its own row or column, which the corridor did not. Those entries
-- stay exactly as selectable and as firable as they were; what they no longer do
-- is back the nest out. A run reached by a straight line that breaks halfway is
-- worse than a nest that stays up one entry too long: the break does not cancel
-- anything, it fires whatever the cursor came to rest over instead.
--
-- One kind of entry in that sweep IS allowed to back the nest out: another
-- claim's own entry, which the sweep would otherwise make unreachable while this
-- claim is armed -- its parent gate being dark the whole time. Those cells are
-- taken back out afterwards, one at a time; see ParentHoles.

-- actually armed (see ArmedClaim): the block used to fade on a geometric guess
-- that the cursor was somewhere on the way to a nest, so a strong dim there
-- would have punished a flick that only grazed the corridor. Arming means the

-- happened yet. Drawn at full strength they promised a live nest and then
-- answered nothing, which read as the sub-palette being broken.

--
-- Clear in ANY direction, but not the same distance in each: the box is this
-- margin across the strip and the strip's own drawn length plus the margin
-- along it. A strip is long one way and thin the other, and leaving it means
-- passing its edge, wherever that edge happens to be.
--
-- Measured from where the pointer was when the palette opened, not from the
-- strip, so it means the same thing in Fixed Position mode, where the strip is
-- somewhere else on the screen entirely.

-- and a palette that dimmed on the first pixel would flicker on every gesture.
--
-- Eased rather than linear, and by a fair margin: the strip holds near full
-- brightness through most of the travel and then drops away over the last of

-- and nothing else -- so a copy that forgot to hide a neighbour's gate or to
-- show its own regions would draw one claim while the release fired from
-- another.
--
-- Three locals have to be in scope where this is interpolated: `btn`, the
-- palette's secure button (which carries a reference to every gate, and holds
-- eapArmed itself); `k`, the claim to arm; and `tag`, the letter this arm goes
-- into the eapGTrace transcript under. Reading `k` as a local rather than
-- baking it in is what lets the two new sites, where the claim index is only
-- known at run time, share the fragment with EnterSnippet, where it is a

-- Which slot a release fires is decided by where the cursor is at that instant,
-- so the decision cannot be made in Lua. Writing the chosen action onto the
-- button from an insecure PreClick fails as soon as the player is in combat:
--
--   ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED  tried to call the protected function
--   'EUIActionPaletteButton1:SetAttribute()'
--
-- Confirmed in-game. Note that SimpleFrameAPIDocumentation.lua does NOT flag
-- SetAttribute with IsProtectedFunction the way it flags ClearAttribute: that
-- flag marks methods that are protected unconditionally, and says nothing about
-- the separate rule that bites here -- a protected frame, written by tainted
-- code, during combat. Do not move this back into Lua on the strength of it.
--
-- So the choosing happens inside a secure snippet. Code in the restricted
-- environment is secure, and its SetAttribute calls are not blocked. Everything
-- the snippet needs is pushed onto the button as ordinary attributes while out
-- of combat, including the arc geometry ArcGeom already works out -- the snippet
-- does no layout maths of its own, which is what stops it drifting away from
-- HitTest as the layout options change.
--
-- A snippet body is compiled against a fixed parameter list, not as a vararg
-- function: Wrapped_Click builds the pre-body with the signature
-- "self,button,down" and the post-body with "self,message,button,down"
-- (SecureHandlers.lua:275,287). So those names are already locals here, and
-- `local button, down = ...` is a compile error -- "cannot use '...' outside a
-- vararg function" -- which surfaces only when the snippet first runs in-game.
--
-- The sandbox has no GetCursorPosition, so the cursor is read with
-- GetMousePosition on a frame handle. That measures against UIParent, NOT
-- against the palette, for two independent reasons:
--
--   * GetMousePosition goes through GetHandleFrame, which refuses a handle to an
--     unprotected frame while in combat (RestrictedFrames.lua:84). The palette is
--     an ordinary addon frame, so its handle is rejected exactly when we need it.
--   * It returns nil when the cursor lies outside the frame's rect
--     (RestrictedFrames.lua:317). Layout sizes the palette to a finite box
--     around its entries, so measuring against it would put a hard edge on a
--     gesture that is deliberately unbounded in depth: a long flick would
--     highlight an entry and then fire nothing. Against a fixed-position
--     palette the cursor could
--     start outside that box entirely.
--
-- UIParent is protected, covers the screen, and never moves. The palette's centre
-- is therefore derived rather than measured: in fixed-position mode it is
-- UIParent's centre plus the configured offset, and in cursor mode it is
-- wherever the cursor was when the palette opened -- which is the position the
-- press captured, since PositionPalette ran in our PreClick just before this.
--
-- GetMousePosition reports a [0,1] fraction of the frame measured from its
-- bottom-left, so scaling by UIParent's size gives UIParent units, and dividing
-- by the palette's own scale converts to the units radius and deadZone use.
-- sqrt is not on the sandbox whitelist; ^0.5 is the same thing.
--
-- All angles in here are DEGREES, and the step and start are handed over
-- already converted. The sandbox's atan2 is WoW's global one, which answers in
-- degrees; math.atan2, which HitTest upvalues, answers in radians. Working in
-- degrees also means the wrap is an exact 360 rather than a written-out 2*pi
-- (`pi` is not on the whitelist), which removes a real trap: a 2*pi literal
-- short by 1e-13 disagrees with HitTest's math.pi*2 often enough to land the
-- other side of the +0.5 rounding on a entry boundary -- 735 disagreements
-- across a 2.7M-position sweep, all of them exactly on an edge.

--  Arming gates -- the pass-through rule, and the exclusive-ground rule
--
--  A nest's cells only answer a release once the cursor has actually entered
--  the claim's own parent entry, and stop answering only once it has left
--  the claim's WHOLE ground -- parent cell, nest, and the corridor between --
--  not merely one rect of it. That is state that has to survive the entire
--  hold, which the release snippet cannot do on its own -- it only ever sees
--  the final position -- so it is kept on the secure button itself, as
--  eapArmed, and maintained by protected frames per claim reacting to real
--  mouse movement:
--
--    PARENT gate    covers the claim's own entry. OnEnter arms the claim,
--                   hides every OTHER claim's parent gate (block layouts
--                   only -- see below), and shows this claim's REGION gates.
--    REGION gates    up to REGION_MAX rects covering the claim's ground -- see
--                   CorridorBox and CellChildGeom/ChildGeom for what
--                   they are. An arc's ground is a wedge rather than a set of
--                   rects, so there its rects are event surfaces only and the
--                   test below is polar. OnLeave of ANY of them does NOT blindly
--                   disarm: moving between two of a claim's own region rects
--                   also fires OnLeave (see below), so the snippet instead
--                   measures the cursor against the claim's FULL region,
--                   geometrically, and disarms only when it is genuinely
--                   outside all of it. Disarming re-shows every OTHER
--                   claim's parent gate and hides this claim's own regions.
--
--  Parent gates sit at a HIGHER frame level than region gates, and every
--  region gate of a claim sits at the SAME level as its siblings. WoW's mouse
--  focus is exclusive and topmost-wins -- exactly one frame holds it at a
--  time -- which is what both rules lean on:
--
--    Exclusive arming, in the BLOCK layouts.  While claim A is armed, every
--    OTHER claim's parent gate is hidden, so brushing past a neighbour's cell
--    cannot steal focus from A's own ground no matter how close the two sit --
--    the in-game complaint this fixes was two adjacent Halo rings swapping
--    back and forth on the slightest movement. A hidden gate cannot receive
--    OnEnter, so B stays unarmable until A's OnLeave test actually disarms it
--    and re-shows B's gate.
--
--    The ARC does the opposite and leaves them alight, because there the two
--    grounds do not interleave: a claim's children sit radially outside the
--    entry ring, and its ground clears the neighbouring entries' own centres
--    (see ChildGeom). What it cannot do is cover that ground with rects -- the
--    ground is a wedge -- so a cursor that has left every rect of A while
--    still on A's ground has nothing left to fire the leave test again, and
--    hiding B's gate as well would leave A armed over the entry the cursor
--    finally stopped on. That is also the one place the two layouts' promises
--    differ: on the arc a claim can stay armed over a PLAIN entry, which
--    leaves its nest drawn open a moment too long and costs the release
--    nothing (the release never consults eapArmed inside the entry ring).
--
--    Geometric arming, at the two moments a gate is SHOWN. Show() does not
--    synthesise a motion event, so a gate that comes up under a cursor
--    already inside it raises no OnEnter at all until the cursor leaves and
--    comes back -- and both of the moments gates are shown are moments the
--    cursor is very likely already on one. In cursor mode the palette opens
--    centred on the pointer, so a middle cell's gate is under it at every
--    single press; and a disarm re-shows every parent gate, possibly beneath
--    a cursor that has already arrived on another claim's entry. Left to the
--    OnEnter edge alone, the nest was drawn and its children dead until the
--    user wiggled out and back. So both moments ask the same question
--    geometrically, in secure code, from the same pushed parent boxes the
--    gates themselves were placed from: the press branch of SNIPPET_PRE
--    after it places them, and LeaveSnippet's disarm path after it re-shows
--    them. Both then arm through ARM_CLAIM, the same fragment a parent
--    gate's own OnEnter uses, so there is only ever one meaning of "armed".
--
--    Same-claim focus hand-off.  Moving from one of a claim's own region
--    rects to a sibling rect of the SAME claim still fires the first one's
--    OnLeave (focus left THAT frame), which is why the geometric re-test
--    exists: it finds the cursor inside the sibling rect and answers "still
--    in", so nothing is disarmed and neither rect is hidden. Nothing needs a
--    reference to any gate but its own here, because the button (eapArmed)
--    is the only shared state -- every gate reads and writes through it.
--
--  Built and positioned only out of combat, alongside PushPalette's geometry:
--  SecureHandlerSetFrameRef and SecureHandlerWrapScript are themselves
--  ordinary insecure calls, and PushPalette already refuses to run in combat
--  for the same reason. Positioning happens in the press branch of
--  SNIPPET_PRE instead, because only that branch knows where this particular
--  press's palette actually opened.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- self:GetFrameRef("btn") is the palette's own secure button; every gate
-- carries that one reference back, however many palettes and claims exist,
-- because the header they are all wrapped through is shared. k is baked into
-- the snippet text rather than read off an attribute: each gate only ever
-- needs to know its OWN claim index, never anyone else's, so there is nothing
-- for a shared body to look up. It goes into a LOCAL of that name, which is
-- what ARM_CLAIM reads -- the two sites that arm geometrically only know their
-- claim at run time, and one fragment serving all three is one definition of
-- what arming does.
--
-- Wrapped in parentheses for the same reason LeaveSnippet's return is; see
-- the note there.

-- "I lost focus" to mean "the claim is left" -- a claim can own several of
-- these rects, and moving between two of its own fires this too -- so it
-- re-measures the cursor against the claim's WHOLE region before deciding.
-- The maths mirrors the release branch of SNIPPET_PRE: same origin, same
-- scale, same units, because this and that answer the identical question
-- ("where is the cursor in the palette's own space") from two different
-- places and must not drift apart.
-- Built with plain substitution rather than string.format: the body below
-- has a real modulo operator in it (`% 360`), which format would choke on
-- as an invalid conversion.
--
-- The whole chain is wrapped in its own parentheses, not merely the string
-- literal at its head: gsub returns the substitution count as a SECOND
-- value, and an unparenthesised tail call in a return statement hands both
-- of them back. EnsureGates calls this as the LAST argument to
-- SecureHandlerWrapScript, so that stray count would have landed in
-- postBody -- which SecureHandlerWrapScript rejects outright unless it is a
-- string or nil, aborting the wrap (and, uncaught, the rest of EnsureGates'
-- loop past it) with "Invalid post-handler body" the moment any claim's
-- first region gate was ever built.
--
-- k is nil for the FLOOR gate, which belongs to no one claim and runs the same
-- test for whichever claim is armed at the moment it is entered. Only two lines
-- differ -- the "is this gate still the armed claim's" prologue, and the letter
-- the transcript records -- and the rest of the body already reads `armed` at

--
--   pressed     the release never ran at all
--   taken       the ownership stamp on the cancel button was not this key's:
--               either another palette was still held, or ESCAPE closed this
--               one out of combat, since that close clears the stamp while
--               the key is still down
--   escaped     ESCAPE was pressed while the palette was open AND the close
--               it asked for was deferred to the end of a fight, so the stamp
--               was still standing when the key came up
--   unscrolled  a scroll fan whose accumulator was never seeded by the press
--   thrownclear a scroll fan whose pointer was carried clear of the strip
--   nocatcher   a scroll fan with no scroll catcher reachable
--   noslots     the palette was pushed as empty
--   nohandle    no UIParent handle
--   offscreen   GetMousePosition returned nil
--   unmoved     the cursor never left the opening point
--   noorigin    cursor mode with no captured origin
--   deadzone    inside the dead zone
--   noidx       an angle outside the arc
--   outofreach  pointer layouts: further than eapReach cells from every entry
--   palette     stopped on an entry that OPENS a palette rather than going
--               through it into one of the entries beyond
--   emptyslot   that entry has no action pushed
